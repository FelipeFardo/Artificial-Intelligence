# Artificial Intelligence

This repository contains a collection of projects and notebooks developed as part of a **Rocketseat** course focused on Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) concepts.

## Repository Structure

- `eda/`: Exploratory Data Analysis.
- `ensemble/ sklearn`: Ensemble methods using scikit-learn.
- `machine_learning/ diabetes_model`: Machine learning models applied to a diabetes dataset.
- `not_supervised/`: Unsupervised learning algorithms.
- `statistics_for_devs/`: Statistical concepts for developers.
- `supervised/`: Supervised learning algorithms.

## Technologies Used

- **Jupyter Notebook**: For code development and visualization.
- **Python**: Main programming language used in the notebooks.
- **scikit-learn**: Machine learning library for Python.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/FelipeFardo/Artificial-Intelligence.git
   ```
2. Navigate into the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Artificial-Intelligence
   ```
3. Each subfolder contains a standalone project or notebook. Choose one to explore and follow its specific instructions if provided.
4. (Optional) Set up a virtual environment with Pipenv:
   ```bash
   pipenv install
   pipenv shell
   ```
5. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
6. Open the desired notebook(s) and run the cells as needed.
